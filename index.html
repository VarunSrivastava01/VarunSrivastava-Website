        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>I am a rising first year at the University of California, Riverside pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration, with a planned concentration in Data Analytics. In the future, I hope to break into the management consulting industry, and work for the consulting wing of a large accounting firm. 
During my time in highschool, I was involved in a number of different organizations and clubs. Having been a member of my high schoolâ€™s Associated Student Body for all four years, I hold considerable experience in leading different aspects of an organization. Serving as a student leader was also one of my most enriching accomplishments, whether it was while I was conducting interviews for potential members or being mentored by our senior members. I was also a member of the Junior Varsity Tennis team, and graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma. My senior year, I also wrote a research paper on the State of Emergency that had occurred in India during the 1970â€™s. 
I am passionate about F1 Racing and supercars. Oftentimes, I find myself spending hours on the internet browsing dealership websites and watching videos about the newest supercars launched. Itâ€™s been a hobby of mine since childhood- even when I was only 5 years old, living in North Carolina, I would always go to Walmart and beg for the newest HotWheels model cars. Fast forward to today, and Iâ€™m blessed to say Iâ€™ve been able to ride in and drive some very special cars. Apart from being a gear-head, I am also interested in investing and the real estate market. 
<br>

        <br>My interest in investing stems from my familyâ€™s involvement and expertise. My uncle, who is in Private Equity, talked to me early on about the power of investing money, and has served as my mentor for years. It is also a way for me to connect with my own father- we spend time talking about the stock market, our portfolios, and the future trends we see. It is both nourishing for me as I continue to learn more, and extremely intriguing. In the future, I plan to enter the financial industry myself, although I have not determined the specifics thus far.
 As for real estate, I just recently became interested in the field as my family and I are currently in the process of looking for a new home. The fast-pace, competitive environment that is real estate entices me.
<br>

        I have also lived in three different countries and visited countless destinations, which is why I have a keen interest in traveling. Some of my favorite travel destinations of the past have been Mexico, Singapore, and Honduras. 
I am a firm believer in the notion that I can always learn something from a person, since everyone has such different backgrounds. In college, I intend to use the social skills I have developed to form professional, mutually-beneficial relationships with classmates and business professionals. In my eyes, the more connections I can foster, the more doors I open for myself.
